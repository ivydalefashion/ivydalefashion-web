## The structure of the Profile page and it's components

-   We still make use of nextjs conventions, of which the main is in the page.tsx.
-   The next component in the heirachy is the \_profileComponents.tsx. This component makes use of Tabs. Almost the entire component is covered by the TabContainer.
-   The Tab container has the first part which are the links to the different components. The second part(lower down the page) we see the Nav links to the actual displays.
-   The displays are all components that we see as all the other components we can see as .tsx files in the profile directory.
